Some detailed assembly results for Nextera Mate-Pair data are available [here](https://github.com/sequencing/NxTrim/wiki/Bacterial-assembles-using-Nextera-Mate-pairs).

####Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/sequencing/NxTrim.git
cd NxTrim
make
./nxtrim
```

####Usage
Trim the data:
```
nxtrim -1 sample_R1.fastq.gz -2 sample_R2.fastq.gz -O sample 
```

Assemble with [Velvet](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/):
```
velveth output_dir 55 -short -fastq.gz sample.se.fastq.gz -shortPaired2 -fastq.gz sample.pe.fastq.gz -shortPaired3 -fastq.gz sample.mp.fastq.gz -shortPaired4 -fastq.gz sample.unknown.fastq.gz
velvetg output_dir -exp_cov auto -cov_cutoff auto -shortMatePaired4 yes
```

Trimming and assembly with [SPAdes](http://bioinf.spbau.ru/spades):
```
nxtrim -1 sample_R1.fastq.gz -2 sample_R2.fastq.gz -O sample --justmp
cat sample.mp.fastq.gz sample.unknown.fastq.gz > sample.allmp.fastq.gz
spades.py -t 4 --hqmp1-12 sample.allmp.fastq.gz -o output_dir
```
We concatenate the unknown/mp libraries for SPAdes.  SPAdes versions>3.1.0 seems to perform better without our virtual single/pe libraries hence we trim with the `--justmp` flag. 

**Note:** We achieved good results using the above commands on the bacterial samples analysed in the NxTrim paper.  These had moderate coverage (<50X).  If you have very high coverage samples, it might be preferable to not use the "unknown" library at all or just treat it as a single-ended library, this will remove the risk of PE contaminants causing problems.

####Output:

The default behaviour expects raw fastq files from a Nextera Mate-Pair library kit in Reverse-Forward orientation.  Based on the location of the Nextera adapter sequence (if detected), nxtrim produces four different "virtual libraries":

* mp: read pairs that are large insert-size mate-pairs
* pe: read pairs that are short insert-sze paired-end reads
* se: single reads 
* unknown: a library of read-pairs that are mostly large-insert mate-pair, but possibly contain a small proportion of paired end contaminants

####Options:

The trimmer will reverse-complement the reads such that the resulting libraries will be in Forward-Reverse orientation, this reverse-complementing can be disabled via the --norc flag.

If you wish to generate pure mate-pair libraries (say for scaffolding), you can use the --justmp flag.  This will only generate the unknown and mp libraries.  Reads with an adapter occurring < minlength bp before the start will be completely N masked.

If you wish to preserve mate-pair libraries whenever possible, the --preservemp flag may be useful.  This will always keep the mate-pair library *unless* a read generated would be <minlength, in which case it will generate a PE.

You can trade specificity/sensitivity of adapter detection with the --similarity flag (1 - proportion of bp differences allowed for match) and the --minoverlap flag (minimum #bp considered on the ends of reads to match with the Nextera adapter).  The defaults were well suited to bacteria in our testing.
